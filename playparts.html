            Peter Stockmann. Good evening, Katherine.

Mrs. Stockmann (coming forward into the sitting-room). Ah, good
evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!<br>
<br>
Peter Stockmann. I happened to be passing, and so—(looks into the
dining-room). But you have company with you, I see.<br><br>

Mrs. Stockmann (a little embarrassed). Oh, no—it was quite by chance
he came in. (Hurriedly.) Won't you come in and have something, too?
<br><br>
Peter Stockmann. I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night!
Not with my digestion.
<br><br>
Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, but just once in a way—
<br><br>
Peter Stockmann. No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more
economical, too.

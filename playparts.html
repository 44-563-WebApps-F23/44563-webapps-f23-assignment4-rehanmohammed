    <h1>Rahan Mohammed acts in a play</h1>

    <h4>An Enemy of the People - Henrik Ibsen</h4>


    <pre>
        
1st Citizen (meeting another). Hullo, Lamstad! You here too?

2nd Citizen. I go to every public meeting, I do.

3rd Citizen. Brought your whistle too, I expect!

2nd Citizen. I should think so. Haven't you?

3rd Citizen. Rather! And old Evensen said he was going to bring a
cow-horn, he did.

2nd Citizen. Good old Evensen! (Laughter among the crowd.)

4th Citizen (coming up to them). I say, tell me what is going on here
tonight?

2nd Citizen. Dr. Stockmann is going to deliver an address attacking the
Mayor.

4th Citizen. But the Mayor is his brother.

1st Citizen. That doesn't matter; Dr. Stockmann's not the chap to be
afraid.

3rd Citizen. But he is in the wrong; it said so in the “People’s
Messenger.”

2nd Citizen. Yes, I expect he must be in the wrong this time, because neither
the Householders’ Association nor the Citizens’ Club would lend him
their hall for his meeting.

1st Citizen. He couldn’t even get the loan of the hall at the Baths.

2nd Citizen. No, I should think not.
